# Introduction
This documentation provides an overview of a project that aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on their health metrics. The project encompasses data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning model training, model evaluation, and the deployment of a Streamlit web application for prediction.

## Project Components
**1. Data Collection**
The project starts with importing the dataset that contains various health-related columns, including Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, and Outcome. The Outcome column is the target variable, which indicates the presence or absence of diabetes.

**2. Data Preprocessing**
Before proceeding with the analysis, the data undergoes initial preprocessing, including:
*  Checking basic statistics with .info(), .describe(), and .shape to understand the dataset.
*  Identifying and handling duplicate records if present.
*  Identifying and handling outliers in the data using appropriate methods.
*  Handling missing or zero values based on domain knowledge and statistical methods.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
The project includes EDA to gain insights into the dataset. Key EDA steps involve:
*  Calculating the correlation between variables to understand relationships.
*  Creating scatterplots to visualize relationships between features.
*  Plotting histograms and other visualizations to examine the distribution of individual features.
*  Identifying patterns and trends within the data to make informed decisions for model selection.

**4. Model Building and Training**
The dataset is divided into a training set and a testing set to ensure model evaluation. Various machine learning models are considered and implemented. These models include:

*  Logistic Regression
*  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
*  Decision Tree
*  Random Forest
*  XGBoost
Multiple models are evaluated, and the one with the best performance is selected as the final model. In this project, Logistic Regression is chosen due to its highest accuracy.

**5. Model Evaluation**
Model evaluation is a crucial step in determining the performance of the selected model. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess the model's effectiveness. Cross-validation is also performed to ensure the model's robustness.

**6. Model Serialization**
The final trained model (Logistic Regression) is serialized using Python's pickle library to be used in the Streamlit web application.

**7. Streamlit Web Application**
The Streamlit web application is created to provide a user-friendly interface for making diabetes predictions. Users can input health metrics, and the serialized model is used to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

**Deployment**
The Streamlit web application is deployed and made accessible to users through a published URL: [Diabetes Prediction Web App](https://diabetesprediction-selvamaniind.streamlit.app/).

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of diabetes prediction, from data collection and preprocessing to model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment. The use of a Streamlit web application provides a convenient way for users to access and utilize the predictive model.
